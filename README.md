## 🛡️ Security Features

### Defense Against Real-World Attacks

Our implementation provides **defense-in-depth security** that protects against sophisticated, real-world attacks targeting web applications. Here's what we protect you from:

#### 🔴 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks
**The Threat**: Attackers inject malicious JavaScript into your pages, stealing user credentials, session cookies, or performing unauthorized actions on behalf of users.

**Our Protection**: 
- **Content Security Policy (CSP) with SHA-256 hash whitelisting** - Eliminates the primary XSS vector by cryptographically validating every inline script. Only pre-approved code executes.
- **X-XSS-Protection header** - Legacy browser protection for older browsers.
- **Strict script-src directives** - Blocks arbitrary inline JavaScript execution.

**Result**: Your site becomes immune to the #1 web application vulnerability (OWASP Top 10).

#### 🔴 SSL Stripping & Man-in-the-Middle Attacks
**The Threat**: Attackers downgrade HTTPS connections to HTTP, intercepting sensitive data like passwords, credit cards, and personal information.

**Our Protection**:
- **HSTS with 1-year max-age and includeSubDomains** - Forces all connections over HTTPS, even if users type HTTP.
- **Always Use HTTPS** - Automatically redirects all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
- **TLS 1.3 preferred, TLS 1.2 minimum** - Eliminates exposure to decades of SSL/TLS vulnerabilities (POODLE, BEAST, CRIME, Heartbleed).
- **Automatic HTTPS Rewrites** - Upgrades legacy HTTP links to HTTPS automatically.

**Result**: Your users' data is encrypted in transit, even if they make mistakes.

#### 🔴 Clickjacking Attacks
**The Threat**: Attackers embed your site in a malicious iframe overlay, tricking users into clicking buttons they can't see, leading to unauthorized actions.

**Our Protection**:
- **X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN** - Prevents your site from being embedded in malicious iframes.
- **CSP frame-ancestors 'self'** - Additional layer preventing iframe embedding on attacker-controlled domains.

**Result**: Your site cannot be hijacked through invisible iframe overlays.

#### 🔴 MIME-Type Confusion Attacks
**The Threat**: Attackers upload malicious files that browsers execute as JavaScript due to MIME type sniffing, bypassing security controls.

**Our Protection**:
- **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff** - Forces browsers to respect declared MIME types, preventing malicious file execution.

**Result**: Malicious uploads cannot execute as scripts.

#### 🔴 Supply Chain & Third-Party Attacks
**The Threat**: Compromised third-party services (analytics, fonts, widgets) inject malicious code into your site, or attackers abuse permissive CSP policies.

**Our Protection**:
- **Explicit third-party service whitelisting** - Only trusted domains (Google Analytics, reCAPTCHA, Font Awesome, etc.) can load resources.
- **Granular CSP directives** - Separate policies for scripts, styles, fonts, frames, and connections.
- **No blanket 'unsafe-inline'** - Eliminates the attack vector that allows arbitrary code injection.

**Result**: Your site remains secure even if third-party services are compromised.

#### 🔴 Browser API Abuse
**The Threat**: Malicious sites access sensitive browser APIs (geolocation, microphone, camera, payment APIs) without user consent, violating privacy and enabling fraud.

**Our Protection**:
- **Comprehensive Permissions-Policy** - Restricts access to geolocation, microphone, camera, payment APIs, USB devices, and sensors.
- **Granular API controls** - Only necessary APIs are enabled, reducing attack surface.

**Result**: Users' privacy and security are protected from unauthorized API access.

#### 🔴 Information Leakage & Privacy Violations
**The Threat**: Referrer headers leak sensitive information (tokens, user IDs, session data) to third-party sites, compromising user privacy and security.

**Our Protection**:
- **Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin** - Controls what information is sent in referrer headers, minimizing data leakage.

**Result**: Sensitive information stays private.

#### 🔴 Plugin-Based Attacks (Flash, Java Applets)
**The Threat**: Outdated plugins (Flash, Java) have known vulnerabilities that attackers exploit to compromise user systems.

**Our Protection**:
- **object-src 'none'** - Completely blocks dangerous plugin content, eliminating entire classes of vulnerabilities.

**Result**: Legacy plugin vulnerabilities cannot affect your users.

#### 🔴 DDoS & Volumetric Attacks
**The Threat**: Attackers overwhelm your site with traffic, taking it offline within minutes, causing business disruption and revenue loss.

**Our Protection**:
- **Enterprise-grade DDoS protection** - Cloudflare's global network filters volumetric, protocol, and application-layer attacks before they reach your servers.
- **IP obfuscation** - Your true server IP is hidden behind Cloudflare's network.
- **Threat intelligence** - Known malicious actors are blocked before reaching your application.

**Result**: Your site stays online even during massive attacks.

#### 🔴 Automated Bot Attacks
**The Threat**: Bots scrape content, perform credential stuffing, abuse APIs, and consume resources, costing money and compromising security.

**Our Protection**:
- **Browser Integrity Check** - Filters automated attacks and bot traffic.
- **Hotlink Protection** - Prevents unauthorized resource consumption.
- **Rate limiting** - Protects sensitive endpoints from abuse.

**Result**: Automated attacks are detected and blocked automatically.

- ✅ **Minimum TLS 1.2** enforced (blocks vulnerable TLS 1.0 and 1.1)
- ✅ **Always Use HTTPS** redirect (prevents SSL stripping)
- ✅ **Automatic HTTPS Rewrites** (eliminates man-in-the-middle opportunities)
- ✅ **Browser Integrity Check** (blocks automated attacks)
- ✅ **Hotlink Protection** (prevents resource abuse)
